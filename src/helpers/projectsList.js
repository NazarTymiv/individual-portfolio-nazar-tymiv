So when you typed name of room and clicked next it will open new room for you with name which you typed another user can type the same name of room and he will be connected to your room and you can chatting with him there. This chat is anonymous because you can put there any name you want and it will not require another personal information. After that when you will join to any room you will not see messages there because all previous messages are invisible for new users and every time when you will reload page all messages will be removed for you."
